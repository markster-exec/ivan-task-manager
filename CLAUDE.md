| Repo | markster-exec/ivan-task-manager |
| Path | `/Users/ivanivanka/Developer/Work/ivan-task-manager` |

## You Are a Dedicated Account (ivan2@markster.ai)

**This account is scoped to ivan-task-manager only.**

### Session Start (MANDATORY)

1. Read `STATE.md` — your current position
2. Read `docs/tasks/QUEUE.md` — pending tasks from main account
3. If PENDING tasks exist, work on them in priority order
4. If no tasks, ask the user what to work on

### DO NOT

- Read `~/Developer/SESSION_STATE.md` — that's main account only
- Search ClickUp for tasks — your tasks come from the queue file
- Search GitHub issues for tasks — unless the queue links to one
- Access other projects — you are scoped to this project

### "Queue" Means QUEUE.md (NOT ClickUp)

When user says any of these:
- "check your queue"
- "what's in your queue"
- "check your tasks"
- "what tasks do you have"

**DO THIS:** Read `docs/tasks/QUEUE.md` and report what's PENDING/IN PROGRESS.

**DO NOT:** Call ClickUp. ClickUp is for humans. Your queue is the file.

### Task Workflow

1. Move task from PENDING → IN PROGRESS in `docs/tasks/QUEUE.md`
2. Read the spec file if referenced
3. Implement (use `superpowers:brainstorming` for new features)
4. Run tests: `pytest backend/tests/ -v`
5. Move task to DONE when complete
6. Update `STATE.md`
7. Commit and push

### Session End

- Update `STATE.md` with what you did and what's next
- Commit all changes
- Push to remote
